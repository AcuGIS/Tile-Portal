The Map Viewr page is what End Users see when they log into Quail.

By default, each Layer you create generates a basic Leafletjs map which can be viewed via the Map Viewer.

The Map Viewer can be reached either via the MapViewer link in the menu or via the Layers page

It can also be viewed via the Layer Preview url directly if the Layer is Public.
